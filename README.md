# Exercises
You will be asked to provide a report at the end of the course. It should contain your solution to the exercises, expressed in your own words. So, no cut and paste from the solution I provided and no 'joint homework'. The goal, for you, is to get familiar with the tools and the technology, and show that you are moving toward that familiarity. When a notebook is used for an exercise, you are expected to provide the notebook file, along with a document (which can be the markup section of the notebook, or a second document) showing how you worked through the problems, and what solution you found.
